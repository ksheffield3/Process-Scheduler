Problem 1B
----------

As you add more CPUs, it takes less time to run a process. So there is not a linear relationship
since it takes less time to exceute processes as you add CPUs.

Problem 2B
----------

8 : 132 switches
	67.9 execution time
	333.1 seconds in READY state 

6 : 157 switches
    67.9 execution time
    316.4 in READY state

4 : 199 switches
	67.9 execution time
	309.8 in READY state

2 : 359 switches
	67.9 execution time
	294.7 in READY state 

Using a shorter timeslice results in more process switching, which is bad on the CPU 

Problem 3B
----------

Round Robin because we feed the CPU a timeslice so it already knows how long to spend
on each process.
